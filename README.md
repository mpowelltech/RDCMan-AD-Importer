# RDCMan-AD-Importer
Script to generate an RDCMan file from servers in Active Directory

This script was built from Jason Noonan's script [here](https://www.pdq.com/blog/rdcman-file-powershell/) - check that out for a full writeup.
I have added segments to generate this file from servers in AD and group them by hostname formats, etc.

It should be run whilst logged into a domain joined computer in the target domain.
